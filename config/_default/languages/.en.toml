### Jiu Jitsu is for everyone!
___
_Located to the left in the main lobby, past the desk.
Then go down the stairs and to the right: next to the pool._

Here at Lazy Leopard, we offer BJJ group lessons for kids (ages 5-10), and youth (ages 11-15). Brazilian Jiu Jitsu can have many benefits to your child's life. 
**First and foremost,** they will gain comfort in knowing they can defend themselves in situations of conflict. Next, training BJJ will help your child build on the physical concepts they are learning in school such as body awareness, physical strength, and cardio respiratory endurance. 
Your child will also improve their social skills by interacting with other children through game play, and partner work. Last, but not least, jiu jitsu provides a safe place for children to have FUN!

Coach Greg is a black belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and trains under Professor Joseph Henle. Coach Greg holds an undergraduate degree in education with a certificate to teach Kindergarten through Grade 12 physical education and health. He also holds a masters degree in sports coaching. He spent 5 years teaching physical education at various international schools around the world before he decided to transition into teaching jiu jitsu full time in 2017. When he isn't teaching, or training, he enjoys Muay Thai, camping, movies, and spending time with his family.
