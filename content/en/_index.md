<h1 style="text-align: center;">How to use this theme</h1>

#### Quick start: how to install üì•

1. Install hugo extended, follow [the official installation guide](https://gohugo.io/installation/). For using this theme you **DO NOT NEED** to execute `hugo new site`, as you will be cloning an example site in step 2.

2. Clone the exampleSite and the theme from the repo:`git init && git clone -b exampleSite --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ololiuhqui/magnolia-free-hugo-theme *YourSiteName*` (change _YourSiteName_ in the command with the name you wanna give to your site).

3. Delete your default `config.toml` from the root folder of your site; the new configurations will be found in `config/_default`. The main configuration file is `config/_default/config.toml`, but most variables are overwritten or defined by the individual language configuration files (eg. `config/_default/languages/.en.toml`)

4. Move to your site directory and see the website preview with `hugo serve -D`

#### How to update ‚ôª

- From the root directory of your website run: `git submodule update --remote --merge`.

#### How to customize üé®

- Use your preferred color palette by modifying the Bootstrap variables in `assets/scss/custom-variables.scss`.

- Change the config files in `/config/_default` and `/config/_default/languages` adding your own elements to the pages. You can change the page names there as well.

- Change the pages names, slugs and metadescriptions in `content/*language*/*page*.html`. The `_index.html` in the root of every content language folder is the homepage, refer to [Content organization | Hugo](https://gohugo.io/content-management/organization/).

- Change the images of the website from the `static` or `content` folders (some pages use [Page bundles](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/)), please notice that the name and the format of the images should be the same of the ones currently present in the exampleSite (that you cloned in step 2 of "how to install" guide).

#### Add new languages üö©

1. Head to `config/_default/languages`.

2. Duplicate one of the language files, change the language tag, name of the file (en, it, fr etc): this should be compliant with [RFC 5646](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/). Use the [RFC 5646 Language Tags List](https://gist.github.com/msikma/8912e62ed866778ff8cd) for a quicker setup.

3. Translate the variables values inside the `.toml` file accordingly to the language.

4. In the `/content` directory, duplicate one of the language folders and change the name accordingly to your new language as in step 2.

5. For each of the `.html` file in `/content`, you can change `title` and `slug` freely. `translationKey` should remain untouched.

6. I strongly suggest you to update the SEO in the frontmatter as well in your new language.

#### Custom 404 page ‚ùì

To add the custom 404 page and make it work on github pages or other hostings, you will have to add it manually when building the site executing `hugo`. This is because github pages looks for a 404 template in the root directory of the project, you can therefore only have one single 404 page for all the languages. To create a symlink to the english 404 version, which will then be used as default 404 once hosting, after running `hugo` run `ln -s public/en/404/index.html public/404.html`.
